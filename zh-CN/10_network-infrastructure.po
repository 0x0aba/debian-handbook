msgid "A gateway is a system linking several networks. This term often refers to a local network's “exit point” on the mandatory path to all external IP addresses. The gateway is connected to each of the networks it links together, and acts as a router to convey IP packets between its various interfaces."
msgstr "“网关”用于连接多个网络。这个词常常用于表示本地网络通往外部 IP 地址的“出口”。网关充当路由器的身份，在它的多个网络接口间转发 IP 包，从而把它所连接的不同网络联系起来。"

msgid "Most networks nowadays use the IP protocol (<emphasis>Internet Protocol</emphasis>). This protocol segments the transmitted data into limited-size packets. Each packet contains, in addition to its payload data, a number of details required for its proper routing."
msgstr "今天，大部分的网络使用 IP 通信协议 (<emphasis>Internet Protocol</emphasis>)。这种协议把传输数据切割成小小的封包。除了实际传输的数据外，每个封包还包括必备的路由信息。"

msgid "Many programs do not handle the individual packets themselves, even though the data they transmit does travel over IP; they often use TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>). TCP is a layer over IP allowing the establishment of connections dedicated to data streams between two points. The programs then only see an entry point into which data can be fed with the guarantee that the same data exits without loss (and in the same sequence) at the exit point at the other end of the connection. Although many kinds of errors can happen in the lower layers, they are compensated by TCP: lost packets are retransmitted, and packets arriving out of order (for example, if they used different paths) are re-ordered appropriately."
msgstr "即使在 IP 上传输数据，大部分程序都不处理个别的封包问题；他们通常使用 TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>)。TCP 是 IP 的上层，为专属的数据流创建两点间的链接。程序只看到数据进来的条目，并保证同样的数据无误 (且以同样顺序) 流到另端链接的出口。在较低层可能发生多种错误，都可以被 TCP 补偿：重送失去的封包、重组到达的封包 (例如，经由不同路径送到) 的顺序。"

msgid "Another protocol relying on IP is UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>). In contrast to TCP, it is packet-oriented. Its goals are different: the purpose of UDP is only to transmit one packet from an application to another. The protocol does not try to compensate for possible packet loss on the way, nor does it ensure that packets are received in the same order as were sent. The main advantage to this protocol is that the latency is greatly improved, since the loss of a single packet does not delay the receiving of all following packets until the lost one is retransmitted."
msgstr "另个在 IP 上的协议是 UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>)。与 TCP 不同，它是封包导向的。它的目标不同：UDP 的目的是在应用程序间传输封包。此协议不补偿封包的遗漏，也不在意封包依序到达。此协议的主要优点是，大幅改善延迟的问题，遗漏的封包不影响接收后续封包，并且持续重送该遗漏的封包。"

msgid "TCP and UDP both involve ports, which are “extension numbers” for establishing communication with a given application on a machine. This concept allows keeping several different communications in parallel with the same correspondent, since these communications can be distinguished by the port number."
msgstr "TCP 和 UDP 都涉及封包，也就是以 \"分机号码\" 模式在机器内的程序创建链接。此做法允许在同个通信中创建多个平行的管道，因为它们以不同的端口号区分之。"

msgid "Some of these port numbers — standardized by the IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) — are “well-known” for being associated with network services. For instance, TCP port 25 is generally used by the email server. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers\" />"
msgstr "部分端口号 — 由 IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) 规范 — 以与网络服务相关而 “知名”。例如，TCP 端口号 25 系供电子邮件服务器使用。<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers\" />"

msgid "When a local network uses a private address range (not routable on the Internet), the gateway needs to implement <emphasis>address masquerading</emphasis> so that the machines on the network can communicate with the outside world. The masquerading operation is a kind of proxy operating on the network level: each outgoing connection from an internal machine is replaced with a connection from the gateway itself (since the gateway does have an external, routable address), the data going through the masqueraded connection is sent to the new one, and the data coming back in reply is sent through to the masqueraded connection to the internal machine. The gateway uses a range of dedicated TCP ports for this purpose, usually with very high numbers (over 60000). Each connection coming from an internal machine then appears to the outside world as a connection coming from one of these reserved ports."
msgstr "局域网路接在私人网址范围内 (不在网络网络的路由上)，网关就需要 <emphasis>地址掩蔽</emphasis> 让其经由网络与外界沟通。掩蔽作业是网络层次的代理工作：内部机器，都被网关取代 (因为网关有外部的路由地址)，借由掩蔽链接，数据送出出去，进来的数据经由掩蔽链接至内部机器。网关以指定的 TCP 端口运行此工作，通常是较高的号码 (超过 60000)。对外部而言，经由内部机器的链接，就是来自此等保留端口号。"

msgid "The gateway can also perform two kinds of <emphasis>network address translation</emphasis> (or NAT for short). The first kind, <emphasis>Destination NAT</emphasis> (DNAT) is a technique to alter the destination IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) for a (generally) incoming connection. The connection tracking mechanism also alters the following packets in the same connection to ensure continuity in the communication. The second kind of NAT is <emphasis>Source NAT</emphasis> (SNAT), of which <emphasis>masquerading</emphasis> is a particular case; SNAT alters the source IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) of a (generally) outgoing connection. As for DNAT, all the packets in the connection are appropriately handled by the connection tracking mechanism. Note that NAT is only relevant for IPv4 and its limited address space; in IPv6, the wide availability of addresses greatly reduces the usefulness of NAT by allowing all “internal” addresses to be directly routable on the Internet (this does not imply that internal machines are accessible, since intermediary firewalls can filter traffic)."
msgstr "网关有两种 <emphasis>网络地址转换</emphasis> (英文缩写 NAT) 的功能。第一种是 <emphasis>目的 NAT</emphasis> (DNAT)，改变封包目的 IP 地址 (与 TCP 或 UDP 端口)。链接追踪机制同时改变后续封包的链接。第二种 NAT 是 <emphasis>来源 NAT</emphasis> (SNAT)，其中的 <emphasis>伪装</emphasis> 是特例之一；SNAT 改变出去链接的来源 IP 地址 (与 TCP 或 UDP 端口)。如同 DNAT，所有的封包由链接追踪机制处理。NAT 只用于 IPv4 及其限制的地址空间；在 IPv6 内，其宽广的地址技术允许直接在互联网路由 (并不表示可以近用内部机器，因为防火墙可以过滤流量) 减少 NAT 的用途。"

msgid "The RSA algorithm is widely used in public-key cryptography. It involves a “key pair”, comprised of a private and a public key. The two keys are closely linked to each other, and their mathematical properties are such that a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by someone knowing the private key, which ensures confidentiality. In the opposite direction, a message encrypted with the private key can be decrypted by anyone knowing the public key, which allows authenticating the origin of a message since only someone with access to the private key could generate it. When associated with a digital hash function (MD5, SHA1, or a more recent variant), this leads to a signature mechanism that can be applied to any message."
msgstr "RSA 算法是使用广泛的公钥加密法。以 “密钥配对” 法比对私钥与公钥。两钥密切连在一起，以公钥演算加密的消息，只能被知道私钥的人解开，以保障其安全。反之亦然，以私钥加密的消息，只能被公钥解开，也就是让拥有私钥的人，可以向指定的社区发出消息。以数字哈希 (MD5、SHA1、或其他) 方式演算，适用于任何签名机制的消息。"

msgid "However, anyone can create a key pair, store any identity on it, and pretend to be the identity of their choice. One solution involves the concept of a <emphasis>Certification Authority</emphasis> (CA), formalized by the X.509 standard. This term covers an entity that holds a trusted key pair known as a <emphasis>root certificate</emphasis>. This certificate is only used to sign other certificates (key pairs), after proper steps have been undertaken to check the identity stored on the key pair. Applications using X.509 can then check the certificates presented to them, if they know about the trusted root certificates."
msgstr "任何人都可以添加密钥配对。采用 <emphasis>授权认证</emphasis> (CA)，即 X.509 标准。此术语指的是拥有信任密钥配对做为 <emphasis>root 认证</emphasis>。此认证只用于签署另个认证 (密钥配对)，经过适当的进程，检查保存在密钥配对的内容。使用 X.509 可以检查其中的认证。"

msgid "OpenVPN follows this rule. Since public CAs only emit certificates in exchange for a (hefty) fee, it is also possible to create a private certification authority within the company. The <emphasis role=\"pkg\">easy-rsa</emphasis> package provides tools to serve as an X.509 certification infrastructure, implemented as a set of scripts using the <command>openssl</command> command."

msgid "The Falcot Corp administrators use this tool to create the required certificates, both for the server and the clients. This allows the configuration of all clients to be similar since they will only have to be set up so as to trust certificates coming from Falcot's local CA.

However, firewalls are often configured at the same time as the real network interfaces, which happens before OpenVPN starts. Good practice therefore recommends creating a persistent virtual network interface, and configuring OpenVPN to use this pre-existing interface. This further allows choosing the name for this interface. To this end, <command>openvpn --mktun --dev vpn --dev-type tun</command> creates a virtual network interface named <literal>vpn</literal> with type <literal>tun</literal>; this command can easily be integrated in the firewall configuration script, or in an <literal>up</literal> directive of the <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file.

msgstr "实际上有两种方法以 SSH 添加虚拟专属网络。较旧的是以 SSH 创建 PPP 层链接。此方法在 HOWTO 文档详细说明：<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/ppp-ssh/\" />"

The tunneling system must first be enabled by setting <literal>PermitTunnel</literal> to “yes” in the SSH server configuration file (<filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>). When establishing the SSH connection, the creation of a tunnel must be explicitly requested with the <literal>-w any:any</literal> option (<literal>any</literal> can be replaced with the desired <literal>tun</literal> device number).

The following site describes the problem in more detail: <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html\" /> VPNs over SSH should therefore be restricted to one-off tunnels with no performance constraints."
msgstr "当 TCP/IP 堆栈封装在 TCP/IP 链接 (供 SSH 使用) 时，TCP 协议用了两次，一次给 SSH 链接用，另一次使用于信道。问题就在这里，尤其是 TCP 改变网络延迟时间的状态。详情见：<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html\" /> 所以在 SSH 环境下的 VPN 应限制于无性能限制的一次性信道。"
